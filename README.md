NightGazr
=========

## What is NightGazr!?

NightGazr! is a horizontal parallax scrolling tumblelog theme.

## Where can I see a live preview?

See the theme alive and kicking at http://nightgazr.tumblr.com _(note: actual dev site - might break from time to time)_.

## What does it do?

### The main stuff...
* Scrolls horizontally.
* Also scrolls vertically if it has to.
* Has a neat parallax effect on the background.
* Makes use of CSS3 transitions.
* An almost-ridiculous amount of user-configurable options.

### The not-so-main stuff...
* Adaptive/Fluid to an extent.
* Basic wiki documentation.
* Clean code.
* User-customizable CSS.

## Why NightGazr!?
It has an evening Manila skyline parallax background and a predominantly dark pallete out-of-the-box. Since it scrolls horizontally, it adds to that horizon-gazing concept making one (hopefully) feel like gazing at an evening horizon.

## The developer?
The start-up developer is Timothy Diokno (find out more about him at http://timmystream.tumblr.com).

## The license?
GPL v3. Roughly speaking, it gives one the freedom to freely use it, alter or derive from it, and re/distribute it - free and open-source software, in other words. :-D
