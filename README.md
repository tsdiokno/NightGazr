NightGazr
=========

## What is NightGazr!?

NightGazr! is a highly-customizable horizontal parallax-scrolling tumblelog theme.

## Where can I see a live preview?

See the theme alive and kicking at http://nightgazr.tumblr.com _(note: actual dev site - might break from time to time)_.

## Features

* Free and open source (FOSS).
* Scrolls horizontally.
* Also scrolls vertically if it has to.
* Has a neat parallax effect on the background.
* Makes use of CSS3 transitions.
* An _almost-ridiculous_ amount of user-configurable options.
* Adaptive/Fluid to an extent.
* Basic [wiki documentation](http://github.com/tsdiokno/NightGazr/wiki).
* Clean code.
* User-customizable CSS.

## Why "NightGazr!"?

It has an evening Manila skyline parallax background and a predominantly dark pallete out-of-the-box. Since it scrolls horizontally, it adds to that horizon-gazing concept making one (hopefully) feel like gazing at an evening horizon.
